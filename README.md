# GDChat - The Ultimate "Daily Chat" Alternative
This is another very small project I made for more than two hours, Started this project weeks ago and never finished it.
## Setup
Enable cURL access for PHP otherwise login will always fail.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SevenworksDev/GDChat
cd GDChat*
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
```
## TODO
- Moderation System
- Prevent spam and other attacks
- Get user icons (gdbrowser api sucks for this bruh tf)
- In-chat badges (Owner, Moderator, Supporter)
## WOW! It doesnt need a database!
